# Adventure-Awaits
Adventure Awaits is a 1.16.5 FORGE Mod Pack that will enhance your survival Minecraft exploration experience.

It adds many different things from new bosses, dungeons, better caves, artifacts, and more!

I decided to make this Mod Pack because i was tired of the normal way minecraft did things; I was tired of the same old tiny dungeons, the same old boring caves, the same old boring bosses, the same old... 

Well, you get the point, This Mod Pack will (hopefully) fix all of those problems if you have them like i do.
